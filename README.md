# bitmap_transformer
bitmap transformer code fellows oct 30 - nov 2
This project performs an inverse transform on bitmap file.
We focused on attempting to use asynchronous patterns in our app files and in our tests. 
The expected input is a 100x100 bitmap file with color palette without compression.
